                    <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the
                        acquisition of
                        knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching,
                        training,
                        storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the
                        guidance of
                        educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or
                        informal
                        settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts
                        may be
                        considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.Education began in
                        prehistory, as
                        adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In
                        pre-literate
                        societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge,
                        values, and
                        skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond
                        skills that
                        could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt
                        at the
                        time of the Middle Kingdom.In China, Confucius (551–479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the
                        country's most
                        influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies
                        of China
                        and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain
                        for a
                        ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his Analects were written down by
                        followers
                        and have continued to influence education in East Asia into the modern era.

                    <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">It’s never too late to make a new year’s resolution. Especially
                        if
                        you’re looking to pivot to a new a new career in 2021. If so, you might want to consider putting
                        learning a programming language at the top of the list. No longer just for techies, mastering a
                        programming language is accessible to everyone. Most importantly, it can open the doors to a new
                        and
                        lucrative career. In addition, it will help to improve your problem solving skills and even
                        provide a
                        productive activity for your kids. However the accessibility makes for a baffling number of
                        online
                        courses to choose from. That said, we’ve put together this guide to the best of them to help you
                        on your
                        way.If you are interested in a career in gaming or developing operating systems, check out
                        C++,and java
                        Is Very inported in programming. It is a general purpose language which will give you a really
                        solid foundation in programming. Udacity offers a
                        fantastic, hands-on C++ online course that teaches you the basics through projects such as
                        building a
                        route planner and writing a process monitor for your computer. The best way to learn a
                        programming
                        language is by gaining practical hands-on experience, which this course has for sure.Simulation
                        based
                        training is another method which uses technology to assist in trainee development. This is
                        particularly
                        common in the training of skills requiring a very high degree of practice, and in those which
                        include a
                        significant responsibility for life and property. An advantage is that simulation training
                        allows the
                        trainer to find, study, and remedy skill deficiencies in their trainees in a controlled, virtual
                        environment

                    <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Computer programmers often are grouped into two broad types:
                        application
                        programmers and system programmers. Application programmers write programs to handle a specific
                        job,
                        such as a program to track inventory within an organization. They also may revise existing
                        packaged
                        software or customize generic applications which are frequently purchased from independent
                        software
                        vendors. System programmers, in contrast, write programs to maintain and control computer system
                        software, such as operating systems and database management systems. These workers make changes
                        in the
                        instructions that determine how the network, workstations, and CPU of the system handle the
                        various jobs
                        they have been given and how they communicate with peripheral equipment such as printers and
                        disk.A
                        programmer needs to have technical expertise with certain aspects of computing. Some positions
                        will
                        require a degree in a relevant field such as computer science, information technology,
                        engineering,
                        programming, or other related studies drives.Programmers may work directly with experts from
                        different
                        fields to create software – either programs designed for specific clients or packaged software
                        for
                        general use – ranging from video games to educational software to programs for desktop
                        publishing or
                        financial applications. The programming of packaged software constitutes one of the most rapidly
                        growing
                        segments of the computer services industry. Some companies or organizations – even small ones –
                        have set
                        up their own IT team to ensure the design and development of in-house software to answer to very
                        specific needs from their internal end-users, especially when existing software are not suitable
                        or too
                        expensive. This is, for example, the case in research laboratories.[citation needed]
