            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.Education began in prehistory, as
                adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed in their society. In pre-literate
                societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and
                skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that
                could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the
                time of the Middle Kingdom.In China, Confucius (551â€“479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the country's most
                influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China
                and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a
                ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his Analects were written down by followers
                and have continued to influence education in East Asia into the modern era.
